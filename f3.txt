This tool rearranges the order of lines in the given textual data. It uses the Knut
h method to do it, aka the Fisher and Yates order permutation algorithm. The behavior of the algorithm
changes based on how many lines are shuffled at the same time. By default, it takes every single line in turn
(1, 2, 3, â€¦, n), generates a random number from 1 to n for it, which is the new position, and moves the line to
this new place. It can also take several lines at once and move them together without splitting them apart. For example, 
if you enter the number 2 in the group size option, it will glue the 1st and 2nd lines together and move them together to
a new position, then 
it will take the 3rd and 4th lines together, then the 5th and 6th, and so on.
